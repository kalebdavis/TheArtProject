Home page:
-Image Carousel
	-First image is a generic art house welcome, saved as (INSERT SAVE NAME HERE). It does not link to anything, since it’s just a welcome. To change this, go into the /static/media/img/carousel images and save a new image over the current one.
	-Second image is a page featuring the sale items. It is a collage type image, which can be saved over as in the previous step. This does not link to anything either.
	-Last two images are featured works. These are selected by the admin. To select, go to the url /admin/, log in with the above art house credentials, and add the featured product into the “featured” group (MORE ON THIS LATER)
